# G7 Data Scientist Technical Exercise
 A repo containing the technical assessment for the JDAC G7 Data Scientist role

In this report, I present an analysis aimed at identifying optimal London Boroughs for the installation of new BikePoints to encourage cycling. Initially, I tapped into the TfL API to gather detailed information on the existing network of cycle docks throughout the city, followed by a thorough data visualization process. Subsequently, I delved into Public Health England's Obesity Profiles to extract data on the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults aged 18 and above. Integrating these datasets, I conducted a strategic assessment to identify prime locations for new cycle docking stations. This approach not only considers current infrastructure but also aligns with public health objectives, aiming to facilitate more active lifestyles among London's residents. The analysis strategically recommends the installation of new BikePoints in the boroughs of "Barking and Dagenham", "Croydon", and "Hounslow".
